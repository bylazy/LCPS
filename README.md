Some interesting LC problems

A look from a non-programmer's point of view on solving some interesting problems on a <b>well-known</b> online platform for coding interview preparation.

As someone with no programming experience, I was interested in how solving algorithmic problems could help me understand a topic.

I chose <b>Kotlin</b> as the language to learn because of its concise and clear syntax, as well as its promise from the perspective of a potential software developer.
